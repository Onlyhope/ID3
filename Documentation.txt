Data Processing:
	
	Missing values in dataset were handle by assigning a value of .000001. Instead of 0, this value
	will prevent the total probablity from being 0.

	Continuous values are classified into three categories. Less than, more than, or equal. They're determined by a threshold.
	The threshold is determined by starting at 0 and increasing it until the best threshold is found. This will be the
	treshold in which the data is organized.

	The best threshold is currently determined by the highest infoGain using an ID3 algorithm, but will be changed later.
